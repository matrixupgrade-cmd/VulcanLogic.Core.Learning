# General-Theory-Of-All-Learning-Systems
What can be known logically about learning systems

note: requires Vulcan Logic Core depository  github.com/matrixupgrade-cmd/vulcanlogic.core


AttractorLearningSubstrate.lean
Starts with the median which learning can occur and shows that learning is a phase of finite dynamics, not an algorithm.

EmergentAlgorithmicTrajectory.lean
Helps clear up where algorithm behavior can occurs in finite complex systems.

NonLearnability.lean 
file about what is not a learning system, what structures can't learn.

AttractorEcology.lean
a mathematically complete account of how bounded dynamical systems spontaneously organize into finite fractal attractor ecologies.

EpistemicHierarchy.lean

InfluentialLearningDynamics.lean

Compacity_CumulativeLearning.lean

SurakStability.lean
"The path is suppression of imbalance. Stability is single-basin convergence. Multiplicity is strictly transient under reinforcement."

SyboxPath.lean
"The path is reflection. Return is emergence. Survival is self-containment without optimization."
