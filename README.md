AttractorLearningSubstrate.lean
Starts with the median which learning can occur and shows that learning is a phase of finite dynamics, not an algorithm.

EmergentAlgorithmicTrajectory.lean Helps clear up where algorithm behavior can occurs in finite complex systems.

NonLearnability.lean  file about what is not a learning system, what structures can't learn.
